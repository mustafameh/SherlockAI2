### **Using OpenRouter Models**

#### API Key
To use OpenRouter models, you need an API key. You can try using the sample key below:

**Key**: `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`

- If the key is expired, create a free OpenRouter account and generate a new key from:  
  [https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)

After obtaining the key, paste it into the application and press **Save Key**.
